# actix swagger

## Ideas

- run function for each path and component with custom mutable state
- run hooks before and after each/all path and components to compute data
- run hooks immediately before rendering to file, to structure and validate data

## Usage

> Not for production use yet

```bash
# Add cargo command to simplify usage
cargo install cargo-swagg

# Add support library to your project (via cargo-edit or manual)
cargo add actix-swagger

# Generate your code with cargo subcommand
cargo swagg ./openapi.yaml --out-file ./src/api.rs

# Format file after
rustfmt ./src/api.rs
```

## Development

It uses [insta](https://github.com/mitsuhiko/insta) for snapshot testing.

Install `cargo-insta` to better review experience.
